## About Me

Software Engineer graduated from PUCV with a focus on implementation and development. I specialize in building robust applications, with a technical background that spans from desktop software to interactive web dashboards.

My expertise lies in the logic and construction phase of the software life cycle, that is, turning software requirements into actual functional high-quality products. This includes building responsive web platforms and desktop applications, with a particular interest in data visualization and system architecture. I have experience quickly learning third-party libraries, some of which had little to no documentation, and integrating them into projects effectively. 
I am highly proficient in English (At least C1 level), enabling seamless collaboration in an international setting.

I thrive in roles where I can focus on coding and technical problem-solving, ensuring efficient and scalable results.
